Description:
    The textile_editor_helper generator is a gemified version of the plugin by the same name. Credit goes to
    the original authors: Dave Olsen (Javascript) and Chris Scharf (Ruby/Rails) of West Virginia University 
    Web Services (http://webservices.wvu.edu/) and to  ryanfelton (https://github.com/ryanfelton/textile-editor-helper)
    for making the plugin rails 3 compatable.
    
    Another genereator, rtextile is packaged in this gem. It creates a migration and scaffold for your textile
    editor. For more info on rtextile generator, run rails g rtextile --help.
    
    Notice: The textile_editor_helper requires prototype. If you prefer to use jquery, edit the initialization
    line in the form partial to look like this: <%= textile_editor_initialize(:framework => :jQuery) %>

Example:
    rails generate textile_editor_helper

    This will create:
        Javascripts, css and files.
