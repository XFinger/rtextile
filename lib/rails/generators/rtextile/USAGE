Description:
    Generates scaffold to create a rails 3 textile editor. Files created: migration,
    controller, model, view templates and routes.
    
    I have gemified the plugin textile_editor_helper and included the necessary files 
    (updated for rails 3) in another generator called textile_editor_helper.
	For more info, run rails g textile_editor_helper --help 
	 
	
Usage:
	The generator takes three arguments, name(model), the objects title and the object itself.
Example:
	rails g rtextile document title post
	This will generate a migration for model(document) with title(string) and post(text) and
	all of the associated files. After running the generator, run your migration and
	run the textile_editor_helper generator:
	rails g textile_editor_helper
